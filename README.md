**Course objectives and outcome**

_Objectives_

The objective of this course is to provide students 
with the fundamental elements of machine learning and its applications 
to pattern recognition. The main concepts and methods of machine 
learning and statistical pattern recognition are presented, 
as well as basic methods to design and evaluate the performance 
of a pattern recognition system.
 
_Outcome_

An understanding of fundamental concepts and methods of machine learning, 
statistical pattern recognition and its applications. 
An ability to analyse and evaluate simple algorithms for pattern classification. 
An ability to design simple algorithms for pattern classification, 
code them with Python programming language and test them with benchmark data sets.

_Course grading and material (6 CFU)_

- Home computer-exercise assignment + Oral examination
    - You can do intermediate assessments instead of the oral examination
    - You can do intermediate assessments instead of the 
    home computer-exercise assignment
    - You can do the oral examination only after the computer exercise
    - Teams of 3 students maximum can do the home computer exercise
- Grading policy = Computer exercise (10/30) + Oral examination (20/30)
- Reference book: Pattern Classification (2^ edition),
